# dataStructuresSolitaire
/*
THIS IS SET UP TO RUN ON WINDOWS SUBSYSTEM FOR LINUX
(includes makefile etc.)

the purpose of the project is to utilize data structures made from scratch
to create a playable, menu-driven Solitaire game.
The interface is console-based and menu driven as the focus is to use the data structures, 
not create a complete app with GUI.
